# Welcome to Terraform Harvester Modules! 🚀

This organization is a collective effort of the community to provide a collection of Terraform modules for [Harvester](https://harvesterhci.io/), which is an open-source hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) software built on Kubernetes. Through Terraform, we aim to simplify the management and orchestration of Harvester environments.

## Modules 📦

Here, you'll find a variety of Terraform modules catering to different needs and scenarios for Harvester deployments. Each module is self-contained, well-documented, and tested to ensure ease of use and reliability.

## Contributions 🤝

We warmly welcome contributions from the community. Whether you're looking to contribute a new module, improve existing ones, or just fix some bugs, your efforts are highly appreciated!

## Considerations 📝

Much of the work in this organization is still in progress. I work on these modules in my free time and decided to create an organization because I believe that Harvester is an incredible tool that the community can leverage in many ways. If you have any problems please create an issue and if you wish to join the organization to help improve the modules, I will be setting up a process for that soon as well.
